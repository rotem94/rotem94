# 👋 Hi, I'm Rotem Rousseau

🎯 Senior Back End Developer | ☁️ Azure & OpenShift | 💻 Java & .NET Core | 🧠 MSc AI

I fell in love with coding at 15 and never looked back. With over 6 years of experience building robust, scalable microservices in both Java (Spring Boot) and C# (.NET Core), I specialize in designing high-performance backend systems, real-time data processing, and cloud deployments in mission-critical environments.

Currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science with a focus on AI, I also enjoy mentoring developers and solving complex architectural challenges in cross-functional teams.
